# Whale Vision Training Suite

This repository contains the training code for two core components of the Whale Vision system:

- **Feature Extraction:** Deep learning models for extracting identity features from whale images.
- **Segmentor:** Neural networks for segmenting whale images, preparing them for further analysis.

Each component is organised in its own folder with specific dataset requirements and training instructions.

## Repository Structure

- `feature-extraction/` — Feature extraction model training code and instructions.
- `segmentor/` — Whale image segmentation model training code and instructions.

See the README in each subfolder for details on dataset preparation and training.
